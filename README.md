# ðŸš€ Simple HTTP Proxy Playground

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a cool little test environment for playing around with proxy server stuff. It's super helpful if you're debugging API clients like Bruno. Here's what we've got:

1. ðŸŽ¯ **Target Server** - Your friendly neighborhood API server (port 8080)
2. ðŸ”„ **Proxy Server** - The middleman that forwards your requests (port 9292)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First things first:
```bash
npm install
```

Then open up two terminal windows and run:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the target server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start the proxy server
npm run start:proxy
```

## ðŸ›  What's Inside?

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Server
- Lives on port 8080
- Has two simple endpoints:
  - `GET /` - Says hello!
  - `GET /api/users` - Gives you some sample user data
- Shows you cool logs about who's calling it

### ðŸ”„ Proxy Server
- Hangs out on port 9292
- Forwards your requests to the target
- Adds some helpful headers
- Shows detailed logs so you know what's happening

## ðŸ§ª Try It Out!

1. Start both servers
2. Try hitting the target directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```
You'll see it wasn't proxied!

3. Now go through the proxy:
```bash
curl -x http://localhost:9292 http://localhost:8080
```
Magic! Now you'll see it was proxied! âœ¨

## ðŸ”§ Using with Bruno

1. Set it up in Bruno:
   - Proxy: `http://localhost:9292`
   - Target: `http://localhost:8080`

2. Send some requests and watch:
   - How requests get modified
   - What the responses look like
   - What happens when things go wrong

## ðŸ†˜ Running into Issues?

No worries! Here's what to check:
1. Are ports 8080 and 9292 free? Something else might be using them
2. Both servers running? Check those terminal windows
3. Look at the logs - they'll tell you what's happening
4. Double-check your proxy settings if you're using a client
